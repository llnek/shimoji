     * A naive way to move an object along its X-axis might be to write a main
     * loop containing the statement `obj.x += 10;` which would move the object
     * 10 units per frame. This approach suffers from the issue that it is
     * dependent on the frame rate. In other words, if your application is
     * running slowly (that is, fewer frames per second), your object will also
     * appear to move slowly, whereas if your application is running quickly
     * (that is, more frames per second), your object will appear to move
     * quickly. This is undesirable, especially in multiplayer/multi-user
     * applications.
     *
     * One solution is to multiply the speed by the amount of time that has
     * passed between rendering frames. For example, if you want your object to
     * move 600 units per second, you might write `obj.x += 600 * delta`, where
     * `delta` is the time passed since the last frame. (For convenience, let's
     * move this statement to an update() function that takes `delta` as a
     * parameter.) This way, your object will move a constant distance over
     * time. However, at low frame rates and high speeds, your object will move
     * large distances every frame, which can cause it to do strange things
     * such as move through walls. Additionally, we would like our program to
     * be deterministic. That is, every time we run the application with the
     * same input, we would like exactly the same output. If the time between
     * frames (the `delta`) varies, our output will diverge the longer the
     * program runs due to accumulated rounding errors, even at normal frame
     * rates.
     *
     * A better solution is to separate the amount of time simulated in each
     * update() from the amount of time between frames. Our update() function
     * doesn't need to change; we just need to change the delta we pass to it
     * so that each update() simulates a fixed amount of time (that is, `delta`
     * should have the same value each time update() is called). The update()
     * function can be run multiple times per frame if needed to simulate the
     * total amount of time passed since the last frame. (If the time that has
     * passed since the last frame is less than the fixed simulation time, we
     * just won't run an update() until the the next frame. If there is
     * unsimulated time left over that is less than our timestep, we'll just
     * leave it to be simulated during the next frame.) This approach avoids
     * inconsistent rounding errors and ensures that there are no giant leaps
     * through walls between frames.
     *
     * That is what is done below. It introduces a new problem, but it is a
     * manageable one: if the amount of time spent simulating is consistently
     * longer than the amount of time between frames, the application could
     * freeze and crash in a spiral of death. This won't happen as long as the
     * fixed simulation time is set to a value that is high enough that
     * update() calls usually take less time than the amount of time they're
     * simulating. If it does start to happen anyway, see `MainLoop.setEnd()`
     * for a discussion of ways to stop it.
     *
     * Additionally, see `MainLoop.setUpdate()` for a discussion of performance
     * considerations.

     * a trade-off between rendering the current frame sooner and rendering the
